# Marketing Campaign & Claims Analysis

This project analyzes an auto insurance dataset to support two key business objectives:

- Predict Total Claim Amounts using linear regression
- Forecast customer response to marketing campaigns using classification models

## 📊 Key Outcomes

- Linear Regression model achieved **R² = 0.76**, MAE = 94.8
- Decision Tree Classifier achieved **F1-score = 0.89**
- EDA revealed strong predictors including Monthly Premium Auto and Customer Lifetime Value
- Addressed class imbalance using stratified sampling and evaluated models with precision, recall, and F1-score

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (for structured querying and validation)
- Tableau (for visualization and interactive dashboards)

## 📈 Business Impact

- Improves claim forecasting for pricing and underwriting
- Enhances marketing efficiency by identifying likely responders
- Promotes data-driven, cost-effective outreach strategies

## ⚠️ Considerations

- Class imbalance was partially mitigated; additional sampling or tuning may enhance performance
- Ethical factors such as variable fairness and transparency were noted

## 📁 Dataset

Contains 9,134 customer records and 51 features including demographic info, policy data, and marketing response.
